# Ecommerce-Linear-Regression_udemy

The dataset is accessed as a part of Jose Portilla's udemy course. The dataset is about an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The target variable is Yearly Amount Spent. We would be using linear regression models to understand various factors influencing the year amount spendings.
